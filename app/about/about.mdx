# About

Hi!

I'm a software engineer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with a primary focus
on front-end development. With extensive experience in building type-safe apps
using **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)**, **React**, and **Node.js**, I'm passionate about
creating innovative web solutions.

My interests in web development span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing
the programming aspect, UI and UX design, deployment infrastructure, composing
APIs, and authentication. Staying up-to-date with the latest trends and
technologies is essential to me, and I always strive to be at the forefront
of the front-end ecosystem.

Over the years, I've dedicated myself to tackling algorithm problems, make designs,
and building [open-source projects](https://github.com/haikhalfakhreez?tab=repositories)
for the benefit of both myself and the people around me.

In 2021, I joined [Involve Asia](https://app.involve.asia/) as a Front-end Engineer,
where I play a crucial role in building the next generation of the affiliate marketing
platform. As the core maintainer of their new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) repository,
I leverage the cutting-edge features of the App Router and React Server Components
to create fast and modern dashboards for users.

Additionally, I take pride in being the author and primary maintainer of an in-house
UI design system at Involve Asia. The design system, built on top of Radix UI,
Headless UI, and Tailwind CSS, is thoroughly documented with Storybook to ensure seamless
development and consistency throughout their newly revamped dashboard.

platforms.
