# About

Hi!

I'm a software engineer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with over 5 years of
experience in both **back-end and front-end development**. I specialize in
building scalable, event-driven microservices using **Java (Spring Boot)**, **Node.js**,
and **Go**, as well as crafting pixel-perfect websites with **Next.js** and **React.js**.

I'm super passionate about building valuable products that a lot of people can benefit from,
and I love working with teams that share the same vision. I put a lot of emphasis on
delivering business value first, prioritizing time-to-market, while also ensuring that the
code is acceptably maintainable and scalable.

I also enjoy mentoring and leading teams, helping people grow as a teammate and as a senior.
I thrive in a collaborative environment where I can share my knowledge and learn from others.
