I love building websites. I work to make a better web; one that is fast, responsive, easy to use, and beautiful. I also have a passion for design and I believe I have the ability to incorporate seamless user experience in both design and development.

I am a 25-year-old self-taught Front-end Developer from Malaysia. My name is Haikhal Fakhreez. I am a young man with an Environmental Biotechnology for a degree, but for the past year I've been working full-time as a Front-end Developer mainly for startups in Malaysia.

### Front-end development

I have around 2 years of experience using **Vue** to make responsive websites that provide users the best experience no matter on what device they are on. I am familiar with most libraries that often associated with Vue (e.g. **Vuex**, **Vue Router**), and the edge-case that comes around when using it (e.g. reactivity). I also have been using **React** (**Next.js**) for the past year, mostly on my side projects.

I believe that a good design is very important. Thus I always go an extra mile to make sure the websites I designed looks the best, without sacrificing fast and smooth user experience.

I also occasionally do design on **Photoshop**, **Figma**, and **Canva**.

As a self-taught, I am highly driven in improving my knowledge. I always try to learn about new technologies that comes around web development (currently checking out [Remix ðŸ’¿](https://remix.run/)). I am also trying to familiarize myself with back-end technologies, currently learning building server using **Go** and **Python**, so that the jump from front-end to full-stack developer doesn't seem that far out of reach.

### Code best practices

I pay a very particular attention towards writing a good, well-documented code. I believe that by having this trait, it helps us to be more mindful when writing our code. I always find myself reading open source files, just to see and learn from the best. Itâ€™s a trait that Iâ€™m super proud of, and valuable to have for a developer in my opinion.
